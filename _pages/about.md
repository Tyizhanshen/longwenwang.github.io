I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests include federated learning and graph neural networks.

I am passionate about exploring the intersection of machine learning and distributed systems, with a particular focus on developing efficient and scalable algorithms for federated learning. My work in graph neural networks aims to enhance the understanding and utilization of graph-structured data for various applications and its combination with federated learning.
